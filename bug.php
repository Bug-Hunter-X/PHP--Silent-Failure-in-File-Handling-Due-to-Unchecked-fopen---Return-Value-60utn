```php
$file = fopen("myfile.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
}
```
This code snippet attempts to open a file in read and write mode ("r+"). If the file doesn't exist, `fopen()` will return `false`. The code correctly checks for this but then the rest of the code operates on the `$file` variable as if it were a valid file handle.  If the file opening failed, then `fclose($file)` will cause a warning, and subsequent file operations will fail silently or produce unexpected results.
